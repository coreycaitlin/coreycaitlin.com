I'm a strategist and tinkerer who works to make things better for people who need to interact with government. My work often includes content strategy, information architecture, research, change management, and human-centered design. I was Chief of Projects at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov), and helped the California Office of Digital Innovation launch [covid19.ca.gov](https://covid19.ca.gov). I'm now at Bloom, where I'm Director of Content Strategy.

Broadly speaking, I help organizations envision what needs to go online, then plan for making it useful, accessible, findable, and maintainable. I love wrangling big, messy content (and human-sized, messy humans) and bridging the gap between how organizations think about themselves and what users need.

Here's some of what I do:

* Put together useful, expressive words.
* Find sustainable structures.
* Omit needless words, paragraphs, and pages.
* Tidy tangled websites.
* Chart realistic approaches to terrifying projects.
* Make sense, except when nonsense is needed.

Here's what I value (in people, projects, and processes):

* Empathy
* Kindness
* Clarity
* Pragmatism
* Inclusion

I'm looking for my next full-time, full-brain challenge. If you'd like to say hello or work with me, [drop me a line](mailto:hello@coreycaitlin.com) or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/coreycmahoney/).
