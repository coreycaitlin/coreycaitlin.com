**Hello! This site is under construction as I re-learn how to [ride a bicycle](https://www.11ty.dev).**

I'm an editor and strategist. My work often includes content strategy, information architecture, research, and user experience design. Most recently, I was Chief of Projects at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov).

Broadly speaking, I help organizations envision what needs to go online, then plan for making it useful, accessible, findable, and maintainable. I love wrangling big, messy content (and human-sized, messy humans) and bridging the gap between how organizations think about themselves and what users need.

Here's some of what I do:

* Put together useful, expressive words.
* Find sustainable structures.
* Omit needless words, paragraphs, and pages.
* Tidy tangled websites.
* Chart realistic approaches to terrifying projects.
* Make sense, except when nonsense is needed.

Here's what I value (in people, projects, and processes):

* Empathy
* Kindness
* Clarity
* Pragmatism
* Inclusiveness

I'm looking for my next full-time, full-brain challenge. If you'd like to say hello or work with me, [drop me a line](mailto:hello@coreycaitlin.com) or find me on Twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/coreycaitlin" title="twitter">@coreycaitlin</a>).
